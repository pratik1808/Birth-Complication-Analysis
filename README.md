# Birth-Complication-Analysis

In this study, we hoped to understand and predict the likelihood of complications for U.S. births. We define complications at birth to be a delivery that requires a Cesarean section, the presence of an infection, or birth weights that are significantly lower than the mean.
The dataset contains 3,801,534 births and 55 different features that detail different aspects of the mother and newborn’s hospital visit. We first performed exploratory analysis to see how the frequency of normal and underweight newborns are distributed using different predictors.

A new column was created to measure the number of months since the mother’s last menstruation cycle and the birth of the child. This was calculated by finding the difference between the baby’s month of birth and the mother’s last recorded menses. We can see that mothers who maintained a regular menstrual cycle past one month into the pregnancy were much more likely to give birth to an underweight baby.

Predicted key indicators and possibility of complications at birth to identify high risk patients by creating predictive models in Python using Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random forests, Bagging and Gradient Boosting
